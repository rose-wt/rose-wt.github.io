# About Me

## My Interest 

<p> I am interested in getting my master's degree. My hobbies include playing the piano, oil painting, and running. For my hobbies, I am particularly inspired by the works of classical composers and painters. My favorite composer is Frederic Chopin. Ballade No. 1 in G minor is an exceptional auditory adventure that everyone should experience. My favorite painter is Caravaggio - not only is he an amazing painter, but he is a fascinating historical figure. </p>

## Websites I Recommend 

- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) - Recommended because the site hosts a variety of courses on different topics, including excellent painting tutorials. 
- [IMSLP](https://imslp.org/wiki/Main_Page) - Recommended for musicians looking for free, public domain music (helps save money on practice books).
