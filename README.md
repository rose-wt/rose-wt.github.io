# About Me

## My Interest 

<p> I am interested in getting a masters degree (and eventually a phD) in Artificial Intelligence. 

My hobbies include playing the piano, oil painting, and running.

For my hobbies, I am particularly inspired by the works of classical composers and painters.

My favorite composer is Frederic Chopin. Ballade No. 1 in G minor is an **exceptional** auditory adventure that everyone should experience.

My favorite painter is Caravaggio - not only is he an amazing painter, but he is a fascinating historical figure. </p>
